===============

News feed reader for courses using the [FenixEDU API](http://fenixedu.org/dev/api/).

This project was later integrated in the official IST's Android Application - [TÃ©cnico Lisboa](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.ist.mobile) under a different codebase - deprecating this project.

This was my first Android Project. It fetched the course news for the students with the corresponding login in [IST's Fenix System](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) and notified the students for news. There are many things that can be improved however but due to time constraints at the integration with the oficial application, development stalled.

(And yes I know that the keys for the oauth authentication are in the codebase but they are no longer valid or registered in the system)
